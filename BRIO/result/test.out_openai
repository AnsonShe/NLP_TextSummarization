Club Tijuana star Juan Arango bit the shoulder of opponent Jesus Zavela in a moment of madness during a Mexican league match. Arango, who scored a magnificent free kick earlier in the game, could face a heavy retrospective ban.
Aston Villa manager, Tim Sherwood, will assess 22-year-old Gary Gardner during pre-season to determine if he is ready for the Premier League. Gardner, who has been on loan at Nottingham Forest, scored a superb free-kick in front of Sherwood during a recent match. Sherwood is keen to see Gardner train day-to-day before making a decision.
